           ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "soumyadipadak@gmail.com"
		   
	Alternative: RSA — The Classic
	
			ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "soumyadipadak@gmail.com"
			
	For the Paranoia Pros: Extra Secure RSA
	
			ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 8192 -C "soumyadipadak@gmail.com"

11. go to C:\Users\UserName\.ssh and open id_ed25519.pub in notepad and copy the body.

12. paste it in (click in profile pic in github-> in dropdown select Settings -> click on SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key )-> Add SSH key

13. test the connection by ssh -T git@github.com and you see the message of success or failure.

**14. after success set this url to use SSH as authentication >> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Soumyadip-Adak77777/gittutorial.git 

15. git push -u origin main and check it in github.
